# SVG Logo Maker

## Description

In this application I created a CLI application using Node.js and Object Oriented Programming methods. I also used npm to manage the dependencies such as inquirer (CLI), and jest (Testing Code). With OOP class methods I built constructers for certain shapes that would then render it. This app is a useful Command Line application that takes in User input to then make a SVG logo.

### Take-Aways

- My motivation for this project was to increase my knowledge of OOP methods and npm by using classes, and jest and inquirer.

- The problem my SVG logo maker app solved is that it helps people create quick logos.

- I learned about npm modules like jest to handle tests and inquirer to handle user input from the command line.

## Usage

This appilcation creates a SVG logo from the command line from your user input.

- After you install all the dependienceis from the command line, your are then prompted with four questions. 
- You can choose the shape of logo (Circle, Triangle, Square).
- You can choose up to three characters to be displayed on the shape.
- The color of the shape or text, which can be a CSS keyword or hexadecimal input.
- After you answer these four questions it will create a Logo for you based on your criteria.
